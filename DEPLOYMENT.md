# Deployment & GitHub Integration

This document provides instructions for pushing the project to GitHub and verifying the CI/CD workflow.

## üì¶ Initial Git Setup Complete

The repository has been initialized with:
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized
- ‚úÖ Initial commit created (273 files)
- ‚úÖ All project files staged and committed
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive .gitignore configured

## üöÄ Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
- Repository name: `laravel-modular-ecommerce` (or your preferred name)
- Description: "Laravel 12 modular e-commerce platform with Filament 4, Livewire 3, and comprehensive CI/CD"
- **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Add Remote and Push

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/laravel-modular-ecommerce.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If you need to use master branch instead
# git branch -M master
# git push -u origin master
```

### 3. Alternative: Using SSH

```bash
# Add remote with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/laravel-modular-ecommerce.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## üîß GitHub Actions Setup

### Automatic Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) will automatically run when you:
- Push to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
- Create a pull request targeting these branches

### First Run

After pushing, navigate to:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/actions
```

You should see the CI workflow running with:
- ‚úÖ 3 jobs (PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4)
- ‚úÖ Each job running: composer install, migrations, duster lint, phpstan, pest tests

### Expected Behavior

**The workflow will:**
1. Set up PHP environment (matrix: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4)
2. Start PostgreSQL 16 service
3. Cache Composer dependencies
4. Install dependencies
5. Setup Laravel environment
6. Run database migrations
7. **Run Duster lint check**
8. **Run PHPStan analysis**
9. **Run Pest tests**

**Note:** Some jobs may have warnings/errors initially due to:
- TLint issues in migration files (doc blocks)
- Some code style issues that need manual fixes
- These are expected and documented in the baseline

### Monitoring CI Status

Add a status badge to your README:

```markdown
![CI Status](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
```

## üîç Verify Deployment

### Check Commit History

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You should see:
```
348e627 Initial commit: Laravel Modular E-Commerce Platform
```

### Check Remote

```bash
git remote -v
```

Should show:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git (push)
```

### Check Branch

```bash
git branch -a
```

Should show:
```
* main
  remotes/origin/main
```

## üìã Post-Push Checklist

- [ ] Repository created on GitHub
- [ ] Remote added to local repository
- [ ] Code pushed successfully
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow visible
- [ ] CI jobs running (or completed)
- [ ] README.md displays correctly on GitHub
- [ ] All documentation files visible

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Configure Repository Settings**
   - Add repository description
   - Add topics: `laravel`, `php`, `docker`, `filament`, `livewire`, `modular-architecture`
   - Configure branch protection rules (optional)

2. **Add Collaborators** (if team project)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Collaborators
   - Invite team members

3. **Setup Branch Protection** (optional)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Branch protection rules
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require pull request reviews

4. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional)
   - If you add project documentation
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Choose source branch

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Making Changes

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make changes
# ...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add your feature description"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Wait for CI to pass
# Merge when ready
```

### Before Committing

Always run quality checks:

```bash
# Using Makefile
make quality

# Or manually
docker-compose exec app composer format
docker-compose exec app composer lint
docker-compose exec app composer phpstan
docker-compose exec app composer test
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Push Rejected

If push is rejected due to remote changes:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Authentication Issues

**HTTPS:**
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
# Generate token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

**SSH:**
```bash
# Add SSH key to GitHub
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub to GitHub
```

### CI Failing

1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Common issues:
   - Composer memory limit (already handled with --memory-limit flag)
   - Database connection (should work with service container)
   - Code style issues (run `make format` locally)

## üìä CI/CD Configuration Details

### Matrix Strategy
- **PHP Versions**: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
- **Fail Fast**: No (all versions tested even if one fails)
- **OS**: Ubuntu Latest

### Services
- **PostgreSQL**: 16
- **Health checks**: Configured
- **Port**: 5432

### Caching
- **Composer cache**: Enabled (speeds up builds)
- **Cache key**: Based on OS, PHP version, and composer.lock hash

- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) - Optional tool for GitHub interaction
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) - For release tags

## üìù Creating Releases

When ready to release:

```bash
# Tag a release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then create a release on GitHub with release notes.
